## YNet

A Godot 4.3+ Custom Module for making online multiplayer games using a node.js socket.io server to connect players together in rooms and relay messages between them.

# Current State

I'm mostly doing this for my own personal use so things are messier than they probably should be, and I haven't been documenting things. I'll try to do some more documentation and add a demo if anyone wants to try it.

Another problem right now is that the Host Migration feature required changes to the Godot Engine itself, so right now it won't compile with an unmodified Godot repository. I have detailed the changes I made here: https://github.com/godotengine/godot-proposals/issues/7912#issuecomment-1963170915

You can also find those changes in this commit of my Godot Engine Fork: https://github.com/DanielSnd/godot/commit/a9b6fa8a9adb0693ed52a6bfc3c93618394a8cbb
